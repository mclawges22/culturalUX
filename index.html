      <div class="intro">
        <p id="thesis">As Internet access becomes prevalent throughout the world, it is essential to adjust digital
          products and experiences to reflect the growing diversity of the user base. People favor websites that they
          can relate to and that reflect their culture.</p>
  
        <p>User-centered design focuses on defining and meeting the needs of the average user. In the past, the majority
          of software and websites were developed in or contracted by American companies. The predominating users have
          been middle- and upper-class Americans, resulting in digital products that are dominated by American metaphors,
          color associations, and left-to-right layouts and navigational logic (Shen). </p>
  
        <p>However, when the user base expands to the entire world, it is tempting to simplify the average user to a version
          of normal that fails to represent the rich cultures that have developed over thousands of years in the various regions
          of the world. However, designs that are not culturally sensitive risk excluding regions based on access to information
          that is not culturally appropriate (Cyr). The new global society faces many decisions in the coming years as to whether
          digital experiences are used to celebrate diversity or rob the next generations of rich cultural traditions.</p>
  
        <p>In my research I will apply the five dimensions of culture established by Geert Hofstede to the main elements of
          website user experience design, conceptual models, page layout, color, and iconography, to discuss strategies for
          tailoring a digital experience to different cultures. I will then analyze three international websites to present
          examples of adapting these cultural elements to a user experience.</p>
