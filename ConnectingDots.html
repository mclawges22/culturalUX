      <h3>Methods for adapting a product <br>to an international market</h3>
      <p>Various approaches have developed for designing products for a vast international market. This is a sampling of terms, which refer
        to various ways of approaching cultural diversity in product design:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Standardization</strong> of technology has the advantage of improved compatibility, but poses usability problems for certain ethnic
        groups to whom the metaphors and visualization used in the interface are foreign (Shen). Furthermore, standardization threatens
        a loss of cultural identity and tradition, which could result in globalization, a theory that Marshall McLuhan spoke of in 1967
        in which digital media would result in a collective perspective of the world shared by humanity as a whole. <strong>Globalization</strong> seeks
        cultural compatibility at the cost of ethnic diversity. However, it is also argued that mass media communication and
        information distribution are introducing diversity to previously isolated and homogenous societies.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Internationalized</strong> products are designed to be culturally androgynous for potential use anywhere. Microsoft and other
        international technology companies pair this with <strong>localization,</strong> which is the process adjusting the product to the appropriate
        cultural context for the user. In addition to language, time zones, currency, conceptual models, layout, color, and icons may
        be adjusted to maximize personalization for and communication with the user, while not impacting the original program and
        development process (Microsoft).
      </p>
      <p>In <i>The Lexus and the Olive Tree</i>, Thomas Friedman defines <strong>glocalization</strong> as &ldquo;the ability of a culture, when it encounters other
        cultures, to absorb influences that naturally fit into and can enrich that culture, to resist those things that are truly alien
        and to compartmentalize those things that, while different, can nevertheless be enjoyed and celebrated as different&rdquo; (Friedman).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Culturalization</strong> has emerged in resistance to globalization by placing value and emphasis on preserving cultural traditions. It
        is a movement that calls people to reject the digital revolution in favor of their identity and heritage. This trend suggests that a
        product developed from within a culture will be more successful with locals than a global product adapted to target that culture (Shen).
