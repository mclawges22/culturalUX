        <p>Visiting a foreign website is not unlike visiting a foreign country. The visitor is surrounded by cues reminding
            them that they are out of their comfort zone. New experiences, signs, smells, currency, language, customs and
            geography may be exciting for an explorer, but quickly turn into a frustration when the visitor needs to accomplish
            a complex task easily and efficiently. In Albert N. Badre&rsquo;s research in &ldquo;The Effects of Cross Cultural Interface
            Design Orientation on World Wide Web User Performance,&rdquo; Asian respondents in particular said that if web sites were
            designed for their language and culture, more people would be willing to use the web (Badre).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Culture</strong> is a complex reference to the beliefs, customs, and values of a particular society, region, or era. Drawing
            cultural lines and grouping users by culture is a difficult and controversial process. There are no strict guidelines to
            use to distinguish where one culture stops and another begins. For the purpose of this research, it is assumed that user
            research has already been conducted to target the user base whose cultural needs should be considered in the user
            experience design process. The focus of this research is on how cultures may differ from each other.
        </p>
        <p><strong class="subHead">How can we anticipate the aspects of a user experience that might confuse or offend international users?</strong></p>
        <p>From 1978 to 1983 <strong>Geert Hofstede</strong> conducted interviews with hundreds of IBM employees in 53 countries. In his analysis of
            the data he formulated his theory that &ldquo;world cultures vary along consistent, fundamental dimensions&rdquo; (Marcus). He defined
            culture as &ldquo;the collective programming of the mind, which distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from
            another&rdquo; (Hofstede).
        </p>
        <p>All people develop cultural values based on their environment and early training as children. It is difficult to classify
        individuals by cultural norms and they should not be used as stereotypes, but instead recognized as different patterns of values
        and thought. These patterns help answer user experience design questions such as:</p>
        <p class="questions">How formal or rewarding should the interaction be?<br>
            What will motivate the user to interact? Money? Honor? Achievement?<br>
            How much conflict, disagreement or debate will people tolerate?<br>
            Should sincerity, harmony or honesty be emphasized?<br>
            What effect will ambiguity or uncertainty have on the user?<br>
            Will advertisements turn off users?<br>
            Should separate sites be made for men and women? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources: &nbsp;Hofstede, Marcus</p>
        
        <h1>Hofstede&rsquo;s Dimensions of Culture</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="fiveDims">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Hofstede&rsquo;s five dimensions of culture quantify the significant differences between cultures
                and how digital interface designs can fail or succeed in translation to the user&rsquo;s culture. Hofstede believes that
                these deep cultural differences are hundreds or even thousands of years old and will not disappear quickly (Hofstede).

                <div class="innerPD">
                    
                    <p><strong>High PD countries</strong> tend to focus political power on a centralized government and have tall hierarchies in
                    companies with large differences in salary and status. The less powerful are dependent on the more powerful and
                    children are taught strict obedience. Skills, wealth, power, and status go hand-in-hand and those in power are
                    highly respected. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong>  Arab countries, India, Mexico, Malaysia</p>

                    <p><strong>Low PD countries</strong> support equal rights and rely on interdependence between the less and more powerful people.
                    Privileges and status symbols are frowned upon and there is a large middle class. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong>  Austria, Israel, New Zealand, Sweden</p>
                    
                    <h3>Power Distance in User Experience Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Access to information:</strong> High PD countries may expect that certain information will only be
                    made available to people with powerful credentials.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symbols</strong> emphasizing social order would be expected in high PD countries and frowned upon by low PD countries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Images</strong> focus on leaders instead of customers or employees.</p>

                <h2>Individualism v. Collectivism</h2>
                <div class="innerIND">
                    
                    <p><strong>Individualist cultures</strong> focus on a person&rsquo;s freedom to choose his or her own path, with
                    little obligation to anyone else. Extrinsic motivators such as material wealth are emphasized and individual rights
                    to privacy and diverse personal opinions are highly valued. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> United States,
                    Australia, Great Britain, Canada</p>

                    <p><strong>Collectivist cultures</strong> integrate individuals into strong, cohesive groups offering 
                    protection in exchange for unquestioning loyalty. Direct confrontations are avoided. The government may
                    regulate the economy, control the press, and emphasize harmony and consensus. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong>
                    Guatemala, Panama, Indonesia, Pakistan</p>

                    
                    <h3>Individualism in User Experience Design</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Personal achievement</strong> emphasized (individualism) or underplayed (collectivism).</p>
                    <p><strong>Definition of success:</strong> Materialism/consumerism v. social-political agendas.</p>
                    <p><strong>Language:</strong> Argumentative and tolerant of diverse opinions v. official slogans and subdued controversy.</p>
                    <p>Willing to provide <strong>personal information</strong> v. protect data singling out an individual.</p>

                <h2>Masculine v. Feminine</h2>
                <div class="innerMAS">
                    <p><strong>Masculine cultures</strong> are assertive and competitive. Conflicts are resolved by fighting. The government
                    spends more money on defense and less on caring for the poor. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> Japan, Italy, Switzerland</p>

                    <p><strong>Feminine cultures</strong> focus on the home and nurturing relationships. Gender roles have less influence
                    in these cultures. Conflicts are resolved by compromise and negotiation.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Denmark</p>

                    <h3>Gender Perspectives in User Experience Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Masculine cultures would focus on:</strong><br>
                        Enumerated tasks and quick mastery<br>
                        Navigation allows for exploration and control<br>
                        Gamification and competition to engage the user<br>
                        Utilitarian graphics and styling</p>

                    <p><strong>Feminine cultures would focus on:</strong><br>
                    Blurred gender roles<br>
                    Cooperation and support through socializing<br>
                    Visual aesthetics engage the user</p>

                <h2>Uncertainty Avoidance</h2>
                <div class="innerUA">
                    <p>In some cultures <strong>uncertain or unknown situations</strong> are threatening and unnerving. Members of these
                    cultures are comforted by the predictability of the outcomes of their actions. These cultures emphasize formal
                    rules and have high rates of suicide, alcoholism, and imprisonment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> Greece, Portugal, Japan, France</p>

                    <p>Cultures with <strong>low UA</strong> tend to more informal, less anxious, and less aggressive.
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> Singapore, Ireland, Great Britain, United States</p>

                    <h3>Considerations for User Experience Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>High UA cultures rely on:</strong><br>
                        Simple, clear metaphors that help reduce &ldquo;user errors&rdquo;<br>
                        Linear navigation model makes it obvious what will happen next<br>
                        Redundant cues to reduce ambiguity</p>

                    <p><strong>Low UA cultures would prefer:</strong><br>
                        Complexity with many choices<br>
                        A more exploratory interface / less control of navigation<br>
                        Less redundancy - color and iconography maximize information</p>

                <h2>Long-Term v. Short-term Orientation</h2>
                <div class="innerLTST">
                    
                    <p>Asian countries influenced by Confucian philosophies for thousands of years tend to believe that a
                    stable society requires unequal social structures. The family is the prototype for the hierarchy of power;
                    older people have more wisdom and authority than younger people (men more than women). These cultures emphasize
                    acquiring skills, working hard, and being frugal, patient, and persevering.
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> China, Japan</p>

                    <p>Western cultures promote equality, creativity, and self-actualization. People seek for the truth instead
                    of virtue (decided by society). &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong> Pakistan, United States</p>
                    
                    <h3>Time Orientation in User Experience Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Long-term cultures would focus on:</strong><br>
                        Practical content<br>
                        Relationships are sources of information and credibility<br>
                        Patience in achieving results and goals</p>

                    <p><strong>Short-term cultures would focus on:</strong><br>
                        Content based on truth, rules are the source of credibility<br>
                        Immediate satisfaction and completion of goals</p>
